# Project 1 - Quote Translator

## User Story

*  As a team we wanted to share quotes in almost any language so that everyone can be motivated by inspirational words.To do this we conceived and built a design that uses multiple server-side API requests. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN the user navigates to the webpage
WHEN the user opens the webpage a quote will be generated
THEN the user may select a language
WHEN the user clicks the translate button
THEN the quote will be translated in the box into the selected language
WHEN the user clicks new quote
THEN a new random quote will be generated
WHEN the user clicks "Save Favorite Quote"
THEN the quote is saved into local storage
WHEN the user recalls the saved quote
THEN the quote will appear in the box

## Notes

### Technology Used
For this project we used a Random Famous Quote Generator API by  , as well as a Google Translate API by .

### Challenges
We experienced a handful of challenges during the course of working on this project. These were the biggest:
*  Getting it to work across all browsers
*  Applying the return favorite quote to back of the quote box
*  Returning to favorite quote while currently in a different language
  
### Successes
*  Translate only the quote box and not the entire page
*  Save and return favorite quote to and from local storage
